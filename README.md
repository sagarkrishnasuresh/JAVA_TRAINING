## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple directories, each focusing on a specific topic in Java or related concepts. Here's an overview of the current structure:

### **1. BasicLinuxCommands**
- Focuses on essential Linux commands that are useful for Java developers while working with the terminal.
- Includes:
  - File and directory management.
  - Permissions handling (`chmod`, `chown`, etc.).
  - File searching (`find`, `grep`).
  - Working with processes, disk space, and system monitoring.

### **2. accessModifiers**
- Demonstrates the use of Java's access modifiers:
  - **`public`**, **`private`**, **`protected`**, and default (package-private).
- Includes examples to show how modifiers affect the visibility of classes, methods, and fields.

### **3. employeeSort**
- Contains a comprehensive example of sorting `Employee` objects.
- Topics covered:
  - Using `Comparator` and `Comparable`.
  - Lambda expressions and method references for concise sorting logic.
  - Sorting by multiple attributes (e.g., `name`, `id`, `contractId`).

### **4. javaReflections**
- Explores Java Reflection API, which allows:
  - Inspecting and modifying classes, methods, and fields at runtime.
  - Dynamically invoking methods.
- Includes practical examples for better understanding.

### **5. lambda**
- Explains the usage of **lambda expressions** in Java.
- Covers:
  - Syntax and usage of lambdas.
  - Functional interfaces.
  - Real-world scenarios where lambdas simplify the code (e.g., sorting, stream operations).
